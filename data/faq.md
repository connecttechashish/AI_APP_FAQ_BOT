# FAQ

## What is this project?
A local FAQ bot that answers common questions using a small, curated knowledge base.

## Where does the FAQ content live?
In `data/faq.md` so it can be edited without changing code.

## How do I add a new question?
Add a new `##` section with the question as the heading and the answer below it.

## Does this require internet access?
No, it is intended to run locally.
